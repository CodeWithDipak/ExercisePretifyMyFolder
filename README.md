## Prettify My Folders
This is my first ever code I have written.
In this code I used OS module of python. I have created a function called soldier. 

It takes three arguments: 
* Path of any directory
* One file containing some folder names of the given directory 
* one file with any format like .jpg, .png, etc.

The written code, first make a list of folders of given directory and then capitalized their names.
It will not capitalized the folder names which is within a given file.
Also it will change the file name from 1-n having a format like .jpg, .png, etc.
